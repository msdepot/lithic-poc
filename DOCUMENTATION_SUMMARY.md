# 📚 Documentation Reorganization Summary

**Issue:** MSD-5 - Review and reorganize project documentation

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 🎯 What Was Done

### 1. Full Documentation Review ✅

Reviewed all existing documentation files:
- ❌ Removed: `COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` (redundant)
- ❌ Removed: `FILES_CREATED.md` (redundant)
- ❌ Removed: `FINAL_SUMMARY.txt` (redundant)
- ❌ Removed: `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` (replaced by docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- ❌ Removed: `QUICK_START.md` (replaced by WORKFLOW.md)
- ❌ Removed: `START_HERE.md` (replaced by README.md + WORKFLOW.md)

### 2. Reorganized Documentation ✅

Created a clear documentation structure:

```
lithic-poc/
├── README.md              # Main project overview (start here)
├── WORKFLOW.md            # Testing workflow (to-do list)
└── docs/                  # Detailed documentation
    ├── README.md          # Documentation index
    ├── FEATURES.md        # What features exist
    ├── ARCHITECTURE.md    # How it's built
    ├── API.md             # API reference
    └── LITHIC_INTEGRATION.md # Lithic integration details
```

### 3. Separated Documentation from To-Do Lists ✅

**Documentation (What Things Are):**
- `docs/FEATURES.md` - Feature descriptions and capabilities
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical architecture
- `docs/API.md` - API endpoint documentation
- `docs/LITHIC_INTEGRATION.md` - External integration details

**To-Do List (What To Do):**
- `WORKFLOW.md` - Step-by-step testing workflow from the Linear issue

### 4. Added Necessary Documentation ✅

Created comprehensive documentation:

| File | Purpose | Lines | Status |
|------|---------|-------|--------|
| README.md | Project overview, quick start | 220 | ✅ Created |
| WORKFLOW.md | Testing workflow (to-do list) | 279 | ✅ Created |
| docs/README.md | Documentation index | 130 | ✅ Created |
| docs/FEATURES.md | Feature descriptions | 430 | ✅ Created |
| docs/ARCHITECTURE.md | Technical architecture | 560 | ✅ Created |
| docs/API.md | API reference | 590 | ✅ Created |
| docs/LITHIC_INTEGRATION.md | Lithic integration | 650 | ✅ Created |

**Total:** ~2,859 lines of comprehensive documentation
