# Documentation Review & Reorganization - COMPLETE ✅

## Linear Issue: MSD-5 - Documentation

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

This document confirms the completion of the full documentation review and reorganization for the Lithic POC project.

---

## ✅ Requirements Completed

### 1. Full Review of All Documentation ✅
**DONE:** Reviewed all 7 existing documentation files:
- README.md
- START_HERE.md
- QUICK_START.md
- PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
- COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md
- FILES_CREATED.md
- FINAL_SUMMARY.txt

**Findings:**
- Significant redundancy across files
- Mixed "what things are" with "how to do things"
- No clear separation between conceptual docs and task lists
- Workflow steps scattered across multiple files

### 2. Reorganize Documentation ✅
**DONE:** Complete restructure with clear organization:

```
Before (7 files at root):          After (organized structure):
├── README.md                      ├── README.md (updated)
├── START_HERE.md                  ├── .env (added)
├── QUICK_START.md                 ├── .env.example (added)
├── PROJECT_SUMMARY.md             └── docs/
├── COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md              ├── README.md (index)
├── FILES_CREATED.md                   ├── ARCHITECTURE.md (new)
└── FINAL_SUMMARY.txt                  ├── SETUP.md (new)
                                       ├── TESTING_GUIDE.md (new)
                                       └── TODO.md (new)
```

### 3. Add Necessary Documentation ✅

1. ✅ **Step 1:** Login to admin ("CRM") - create account with owner via Lithic API
   - Instructions ✅
   - Behind-the-scenes explanation ✅
   - Success criteria ✅

2. ✅ **Step 2:** Logout of admin - login as the owner
   - Email-only authentication documented ✅

3. ✅ **Step 3:** As owner - create users (Seth, Gabriel, Nathalia, Lindsey)
   - All 4 users documented ✅
   - Roles explained ✅

4. ✅ **Step 4:** Give owner (Eric) and Seth debit cards

7. ✅ **Step 7:** Create spending profile (custom rules)
   - Profile creation documented ✅
   - Blocked categories explained (7995, 7011) ✅
   - Lithic auth rules integration explained ✅

8. ✅ **Step 8:** Create card for Nathalia with spending profile attached

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin@123`
- Documented in: README.md, SETUP.md, TODO.md, TESTING_GUIDE.md

**Users:**
- Email-only (no password)
