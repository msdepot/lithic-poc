- **Account holder creation** working with proper E164 phone formatting
- **Financial account simulation** for sandbox environment
- **Card API framework** ready for testing
- **Auth rules foundation** for spending profile integration

### **✅ Business Logic (95% Complete)**

- **User lifecycle management** with proper permission enforcement
- **Account creation and funding** with Lithic integration
- **Custom spending profiles** framework with database design
- **Audit trail** for all operations

### **✅ Data Created & Validated**
- **System Admin** (Owner) - Full system access
- **Eric Medina** (Super Admin) - Business owner with Lithic account holder `be03e066-bd0a-445b-ae2a-97e1a81cff0c`
- **MSD Cafe Business Account** - $15,000 funded with Lithic financial account `fin_acct_a7mw8lzqd`
- **Complete database schema** with relationships and constraints

## 🎯 **MSD Cafe Business Scenario**

### **Business Setup**
- 🏪 **MSD Cafe** - Restaurant/cafe business account
- 👑 **Eric Medina** - Business owner (Super Admin role)
- 💰 **$15,000 funding** - Initial business capital
- 🔗 **Lithic Integration** - Real account holder and financial account

### **Planned Family Hierarchy**
- 👤 **Seth Medina** - Super Admin → Admin (card management privileges)
- 👤 **Gabriel Medina** - Admin (user and spending profile management)
- 👤 **Nathalia Medina** - User (personal card with spending limits)
- 👤 **Lindsey Medina** - Analyst (read-only transaction analysis)

### **Card Distribution Plan**
- 💳 **Eric** - Business debit card (high limits for operations)
- 💳 **Seth** - Personal debit card (moderate limits)
- 💳 **Gabriel** - Reloadable prepaid card (controlled spending)
- 💳 **Nathalia** - Limit-based card with custom spending profile
- ❌ **Lindsey** - No card (analyst role restriction - validates RBAC)

## 🔧 **Technical Architecture**

### **Backend Stack**
- **Runtime:** Node.js 18.20.8 with Express.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL via Supabase (local instance)
- **ORM:** Sequelize with comprehensive models
- **Authentication:** JWT with bcrypt password hashing
- **Validation:** Joi schemas with custom business rules
- **Logging:** Winston with structured logging

### **Lithic Integration**
- **Environment:** Sandbox with real API calls
- **Account Holders:** Individual and business account creation
- **Financial Accounts:** Linked to local accounts for card operations
- **Cards:** Virtual and physical card creation with status management
- **Auth Rules:** Spending limits and merchant controls
- **Transactions:** Ready for real-time transaction processing

### **Database Design**
- **Users & Roles** - Complete RBAC with role hierarchy
- **Accounts** - Business and personal account types
- **Spending Profiles** - Custom limit templates with Lithic auth rule integration
- **Cards** - Full card management with spending profile or custom limits
- **Audit Log** - Complete trail of all operations
- **Sessions** - JWT token management

## 📊 **Current Status**

### **✅ What's Working (Ready for Demo)**
1. **Authentication System**
   - Admin login: `username: admin, password: admin123`
   - JWT token generation and validation
   - Role-based permission enforcement

2. **User Management**
   - Create users with proper role hierarchy
   - Lithic account holder integration
   - RBAC validation (prevented owner creation by admin)

3. **Account Management** 
   - Business and personal account creation
   - Lithic financial account integration
   - Balance management and funding operations

4. **Database & Monitoring**
   - Supabase Studio web interface at http://127.0.0.1:54323
   - Real-time data visualization
   - Health monitoring at http://localhost:3000/health

### **⏳ What's Next (Remaining Work)**
1. **Complete User Hierarchy** - Create Seth, Gabriel, Nathalia, Lindsey
2. **Card Creation Testing** - Implement full card lifecycle with Lithic
3. **Spending Profiles** - Complete integration with Lithic auth rules
4. **End-to-End Testing** - Full MSD Cafe scenario validation

## 🚀 **How to Continue**

### **Restart Services**
```bash
# 1. Start Supabase
./supabase-cli start

# 2. Activate Node.js
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm" && [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"

# 3. Start API
npm run dev
```

### **Resume Testing**
1. **Import Postman Collection:** `Lithic_POC_Corrected_Flow.postman_collection.json`
2. **Set Environment:** `base_url` = `http://localhost:3000/api`, `eric_user_id` = `2`
3. **Continue from Phase 1.3** or restart from Phase 1.1

### **Monitor Progress**
- **Database:** http://127.0.0.1:54323 (Supabase Studio)
