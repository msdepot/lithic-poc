## üéØ Key Concepts

These concepts are explained in detail throughout the documentation:

### Multi-Tenant Architecture
Each business account has its own isolated set of users and cards.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Four user roles with different permission levels:
- **Owner** - Full control
- **Admin** - User and card management
- **User** - Limited access
- **Analyst** - Read-only

### Lithic Integration
Real integration with Lithic's sandbox API:
- Account holder creation
- Financial account management
- Card creation
- Auth rules (spending profiles)

### Spending Profiles
Reusable restriction templates that can be applied to multiple cards, enforcing:
- Spending limits
- Merchant category controls
- Duration-based limits
