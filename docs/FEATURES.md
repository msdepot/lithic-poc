Create reusable templates of spending restrictions that can be applied to multiple cards.

### What is a Spending Profile?

A spending profile is a **saved set of rules** that includes:

- Other authorization rules

### Why Use Spending Profiles?

**Without Profiles:**
- Set limits on each card individually
- Repeat same restrictions multiple times
- Hard to maintain consistency

**With Profiles:**
- Define rules once
- Apply to multiple cards
- Update once, affects all cards
- Maintain consistency across teams

### Profile Components

#### Spending Limits
- **Amount:** Maximum spend amount
- **Duration:** Time period (daily/monthly/yearly)
- **Applies to:** All cards using this profile

#### Merchant Category Controls

**Blocked Categories:**
- Specify MCC codes to block
- Example: `7995` (gambling), `7011` (hotels)
- Card will be declined at these merchants

**Allowed Categories:**
- Specify only allowed MCC codes
- All other categories blocked
- Example: `5411` (grocery), `5814` (fast food)

### Common MCC Codes

| MCC | Category | Use Case |
|-----|----------|----------|
| 5411 | Grocery Stores | Allow food purchases |
| 5812 | Eating Places | Allow restaurant meals |
| 5814 | Fast Food | Allow quick meals |
| 5541 | Service Stations | Allow fuel |
| 7011 | Lodging | Block/allow hotels |
