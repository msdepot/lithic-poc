- Monitoring and logging infrastructure

### **⏳ What Needs Completion (15% remaining)**
- Complete user hierarchy creation (Seth, Gabriel, Nathalia, Lindsey)
- Card creation testing with real Lithic integration
- Spending profiles with auth rules implementation
- End-to-end Postman collection testing
- Final validation of complete business scenario

## 🚀 **How to Continue**

### **Immediate Next Steps**
1. **Run `./start.sh`** - Starts all services in one command
2. **Open Supabase Studio** - http://127.0.0.1:54323 to monitor data
3. **Import Postman collection** - `Lithic_POC_Corrected_Flow.postman_collection.json`
4. **Set environment variable** - `eric_user_id = 2` to fix JSON parsing
5. **Continue Phase 1.3** - Create MSD Cafe account (should work now)

### **Expected Completion Timeline**
- **User hierarchy creation:** 45 minutes
- **Card creation testing:** 60 minutes  
- **Spending profiles:** 45 minutes
- **Final validation:** 30 minutes
- **Total remaining:** ~3 hours to 100% completion

## 🎯 **Success Criteria for Completion**

### **Functional Goals**
- [ ] All 5 Medina family members created with appropriate roles
- [ ] MSD Cafe business account operational and funded
- [ ] 4 different card types created (debit, prepaid, limit-based)
- [ ] Spending profile created and applied to Nathalia's card
- [ ] RBAC validation confirmed (Lindsey blocked from cards)
- [ ] Card operations working (lock/unlock/status management)

### **Technical Goals**
- [ ] All Lithic API integrations functional with real sandbox calls
- [ ] Complete audit trail of all operations in database
- [ ] Postman collection runs end-to-end without errors
- [ ] Health checks confirm all services operational
- [ ] Error handling graceful for all failure scenarios

### **Business Goals**
- [ ] Complete payment card management lifecycle demonstrated
- [ ] Role-based access control validated at all levels
- [ ] Custom spending controls working via Lithic auth rules
- [ ] Account funding and balance management operational
- [ ] Real-world fintech application patterns implemented

## 💡 **Key Insights Discovered**

### **Lithic API Learnings**
- Account holders require exact E164 phone number format
- Required fields must be at top-level in API requests
- Sandbox environment has some API method differences
- KYC exemption type required for sandbox account holders
- Financial accounts may be auto-created in some scenarios

### **Architecture Decisions**
- Simplified authentication works better than complex session management
- Supabase provides excellent development experience with web interface
- RBAC enforcement should happen at multiple layers
- Real-time monitoring essential for debugging integration issues
- Comprehensive error logging crucial for API debugging
