## üîë Key Points

### Authentication (No Passwords)
- **Admin CRM:** Uses username/password (`admin`/`admin@123`)
- **Users:** Email-only login (no password required for POC)
- This is intentional for POC simplicity

### Roles & Permissions
- **Owner:** Full control of the account
- **Admin:** Can create users and cards
- **User:** Limited access (can view own cards)
- **Analyst:** Read-only access

### Spending Profiles
Spending profiles are **reusable templates** that:
1. Store custom rules in our database
2. Create auth rules via Lithic API
3. Can be attached to multiple cards
4. Include spend limits, durations, and merchant category controls
